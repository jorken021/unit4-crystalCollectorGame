Generate a random number between 19 - 120, and assign it to the Target Number variable

Generate  a random number between 1 - 12 and assign it to a crystal until each crystal is assigned a value that is not equal to zero. 

Crystals: Connect each assigned value to the Total Score variable so that as 
selections are made and buttons are pressed, the Total Score box tracks progression towards the Target Number. 

Check for equality between the Total Score and the Target Score. 

If the Total Score becomes equal to the Target Score, pregress to another round and increment the Wins value by +1

If the Total Score exceeds the Target Number, reset the game and increment the Losses value by +1
